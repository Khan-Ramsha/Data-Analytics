## Introduction

Welcome to the SQL Detective Challenge and Web Scraping Adventure! In this project, you will step into the shoes of a detective to solve a murder mystery using SQL, while also embarking on a web scraping adventure to collect data for analysis.

## SQL Detective Challenge

Introduction to the Case
Familiarize yourself with the murder mystery case provided. Understand the structure of the crime data, including tables and relationships.

## Database Setup

Set up an SQL database, either locally or using an online platform like SQLite or MySQL. Create tables that align with the information provided in the murder mystery case.

## SQL Queries
 Develop SQL queries to extract relevant information from the database. Use SELECT statements, JOIN operations, and WHERE clauses to uncover clues and solve the murder mystery.

## Analysis and Conclusion
Analyze the results of your SQL queries to piece together the sequence of events and identify potential suspects. Conclude the detective challenge by summarizing your findings and presenting a compelling case.

## Web Scraping Adventure

Choose a Target Website
Select a website from which you want to collect data. Ensure it aligns with your interests or industry preferences.

## Understand the Structure

Analyze the structure of the chosen website, identifying key elements and the location of the data you want to scrape.

## Web Scraping Implementation

Utilize Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests to perform web scraping. Extract relevant data from the website and store it in a suitable format for analysis.

## Dataset Documentation
