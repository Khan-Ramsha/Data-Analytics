# ðŸ›’ Superstore Sales Data Analysis ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the Superstore Sales Data Analysis project! Dive into the bustling world of retail with our global superstore dataset spanning four years. Let's unravel the mysteries hidden within the data and uncover actionable insights to drive business decisions!

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This dataset encapsulates the retail journey of a global superstore over a period of four years. Our mission is to conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to unveil trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Approach

### Univariate Analysis ðŸ“ˆ

1. **Understand Dataset**: Explore the structure of the dataset, encompassing essential details such as the number of rows and columns.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Tidy up the data by handling missing values and anomalies.
3. **Data Types**: Verify the appropriateness of data types for each column.
4. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate basic descriptive statistics for key numeric variables, such as sales and quantity.
5. **Histograms**: Visualize the distribution of key numeric variables to understand their spread.
6. **Time Series Plots**: Plot time series graphs to decipher trends and patterns in sales over the four-year period.
7. **Seasonal Decomposition**: Decompose time series data to reveal components like trend, seasonality, and residuals.
8. **Box Plots**: Identify outliers and grasp the distribution of numeric variables.
9. **Sales Distribution by Category**: Visualize sales distribution across different categories using bar charts or pie charts.
10. **Sales Variation Over Time**: Observe how sales vary over different time periods using line charts (e.g., months, quarters, years).

### Bivariate Analysis ðŸ“Š

1. **Correlation Analysis**: Examine the correlation between sales and other relevant numeric variables.
2. **Scatter Plots**: Explore the relationship between sales and another numeric variable.
3. **Pair Plots**: Obtain a quick overview of relationships between multiple numeric variables.
4. **Category-wise Sales Trends**: Analyze how sales trends differ across different categories using line charts.
5. **Heatmaps**: Visualize the correlation matrix for deeper insights.
6. **Sales by Region**: Compare sales across different regions using bar charts or stacked bar charts.
7. **Customer Segment Analysis**: Explore sales trends for different customer segments using line charts or bar charts.
8. **Sales vs. Quantity**: Investigate the relationship between sales and quantity sold using scatter plots.
9. **Customer Segment vs. Quantity**: Compare the quantity sold across different customer segments using bar charts.
10. **Discount Impact on Sales**: Analyze the impact of discounts on sales using bar charts or line charts.
11. **Shipping Mode vs. Sales**: Explore the relationship between shipping modes and sales using categorical plots.
12. **Product-wise Sales Analysis**: Investigate sales variations for different products or categories using bar charts or line charts.
13. **Region-wise Product Sales**: Compare product sales across different regions using grouped bar charts.
14. **Document Findings**: Summarize key findings from both univariate and bivariate analyses, highlighting notable trends or insights.
